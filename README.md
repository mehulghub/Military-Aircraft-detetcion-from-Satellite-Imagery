# Military-Aircraft-detetcion-from-Satellite-Imagery
Object Detetction from Satellite Imagery has been of innumerable applications since ever. Every sector from WEATHER FORECAST prediction to identifying targets in MILITARY DOMAIN, Satellite Images have been a boon to penetrating into worldwide applications. This respository specifically aims to detect Military Aircrafts from Satellite Imagery. With the target to take valuable insights of the quantity/quality of warplanes beforehand, necessary preparations could be made by the respective Countries/ Areas/ Organisations, etc. Detectron2 is used for the first repository for Military Aircraft Detection. More Object Detetcors will be added to lead this to comparative and better Results. Dataset for this project was taken from ROBOFLOW.
