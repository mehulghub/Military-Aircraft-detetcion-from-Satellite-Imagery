# Military-Aircraft-detection-from-Satellite-Imagery
Object Detection from Satellite Imagery has been of innumerable applications ever since. In every sector from WEATHER FORECAST prediction to identifying targets in MILITARY DOMAIN, Satellite Images have been a boon to penetrating into worldwide applications. This repository specifically aims to detect Military aircraft from Satellite Imagery. The aim is to take valuable insights into the quantity/quality of warplanes beforehand, so that necessary preparation could be made by the respective target Countries/ Areas/ Organisations, etc. Detectron2 is used as the first repository for Military Aircraft Detection. More Object Detectors will be added to lead this to comparative and better Results. The dataset for this project was taken from ROBOFLOW.
